## Install Git Hooks

```bash
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

This activates three hooks via `core.hooksPath`:

- **pre-commit** — runs `ruff check .` and `pytest` before every commit.
- **commit-msg** — enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- **pre-push** — owner-locked: refuses to push anywhere except `github.com/cocodedk`
  (including the `github.com-cocodedk` SSH alias), and blocks force-push or deletion
  of protected branches (`main`/`master`).

Caveats: `core.hooksPath` is per-clone and not committed — run the installer after every
fresh clone. `git push --no-verify` bypasses the hooks by design (for genuine emergencies).
Pushes from CI or the GitHub web UI do not invoke these hooks; for public repos, branch
protection (see `scripts/setup-repo.sh`) provides the server-side guarantee.

## Local Git Setup

```bash
git config pull.rebase true
git config core.autocrlf input
git config push.autoSetupRemote true

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whisperframe.git
cd whisperframe

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cocode-dk/whisperframe.git

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv env

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=.

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_video_transcriber.py

# Run tests with verbose output
python -m pytest -v
```

## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with some modifications:

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- **Docstrings**: Google style
- **Type hints**: Required for public functions
- **Imports**: Grouped and sorted

### Code Formatting

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting:

```bash
# Install Black
pip install black

# Format code
black .

# Check formatting
black --check .
```

### Import Sorting

We use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting:

```bash
# Install isort
pip install isort

# Sort imports
isort .

# Check import sorting
isort --check-only .
```

### Linting

We use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting:

```bash
# Install flake8
pip install flake8

# Run linting
flake8 .
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── test_video_transcriber.py
├── test_video_frame_extractor.py
├── test_utils.py
└── conftest.py
```

### Writing Tests

- **Test one thing** per test function
- **Use descriptive names** for test functions
- **Test both success and failure** cases
- **Use fixtures** for common setup
- **Mock external dependencies**

**Example Test:**
```python
import pytest
from pathlib import Path
from video_transcriber import VideoTranscriber

def test_video_transcriber_initialization():
    """Test VideoTranscriber initialization with valid video file."""
    video_path = "tests/fixtures/sample_video.mp4"
    transcriber = VideoTranscriber(video_path)

    assert transcriber.video_path == Path(video_path)
    assert transcriber.language == "auto"
    assert transcriber.model == "small"

def test_video_transcriber_invalid_file():
    """Test VideoTranscriber initialization with invalid file."""
    with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
        VideoTranscriber("nonexistent_file.mp4")
```

### Test Fixtures

Create reusable test data in `conftest.py`:

```python
import pytest
from pathlib import Path

@pytest.fixture
def sample_video_path():
    """Provide path to sample video file."""
    return Path("tests/fixtures/sample_video.mp4")

@pytest.fixture
def temp_output_dir(tmp_path):
    """Provide temporary output directory."""
    return tmp_path / "output"
```
